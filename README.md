# Cartographer Hangman Game

Do you ever want to test your knowledge of all the 50 states?  If so, check out this app.

## What is this?
A straight-forward hangman game about all 50 states (and D.C.).  Each user gets a total of 3 wrong guesses.

## How do I Play it?
- Go to the webpage: https://bcimbali.github.io/Hangman-Game/
- A section of blanks will appear in the top middle of the screen
- You make your guess by typing the letter on your keyboard
- If the guess is correct, you will see your guessed letter appear in the blanks. If your guess is incorrect, you will lose a guess.
- Once you get a correct state name, you will see that state become illuminated on the map below
- If you feel particularly stuck, click on the `Click for a Hint` button in the top-right section of the screen and a hint/fun fact about that state will appear.
- Try to guess all of the states!
